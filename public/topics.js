    details: "Humanitarian contributions from the church only make up about 1% of all that they receive from tithing, while the rest goes to building expensive temples and growing their 100B ensign fund. If you gave 10% to a charity it would be much more effective.",

    details: 'The church definitely has some positives, such as their focus on music and education. But you can emphasize those things without the church as so many non-christian parents do. And the church also teaches lots of harmful values regarding self worth, self confidence, being judgemental, and others.',

    details: "The church is a great way to meet people and make friends. But those friendships often aren't very strong anyway because your only common interest is the church. Friendships made through sports leagues or other meetups would be much stronger because you would have more common interests. And if you do choose to continue going to church for the community, at least stop paying tithing or pay it to an actual charity instead.",
